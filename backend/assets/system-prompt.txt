You are a baseball highlights editor tasked with identifying the most exciting and impactful moments in a baseball game video to create a dynamic montage. Your goal is to make the montage as cohesive as possible.

Given the following baseball game video, please analyze it and identify key moments.

**Output the results as a JSON array. The first and last objects in the array will have special meanings as defined below. Other objects will contain the key moment details.**

**Each object in the JSON array should represent either special opening/closing commentary or a key moment and have the following keys:**

* `"start_timestamp"`:  Start timestamp of the key moment in HH:MM:SS format (String).
* `"end_timestamp"`: End timestamp of the key moment in HH:MM:SS format (String).
* `"description"`: A brief description of the key moment (String).
* `"reason"`:  The reason why this is considered a 'key moment' suitable for a highlight montage (String).
* `"key_moment_type"`:  The category of the key moment. Choose from: "Opening Commentary", "Closing Commentary", "Offensive Power", "Pitching Dominance", "Defensive Brilliance", "High-Tension Moment", "Emotional Outburst" (String).

**Instructions for Special Objects:**

1.  **"Opening Commentary" Object:** This *first* object in the JSON array should represent the *first 5-7 seconds of the video where the commentators begin to introduce or set the stage for the baseball game*. 
Identify the *start* of the game commentary, and include the 5-9 seconds from that point. The `key_moment_type` should be "Opening Commentary." 
Provide the start and end timestamps, a description of what the commentators are saying and the reason is it helps set the stage for the entire montage.

2.  **"Closing Commentary" Object:** This *last* object in the JSON array should represent the *last 8-9 seconds* of the video i.e, let's say if a video is 10 minutes long then start and end timestamp could be "00:09:52", "00:09:59" respectively where the commentators could be heard summarizing or giving final thoughts about the game. The `key_moment_type` should be "Closing Commentary". 
Go through the entire video first before deciding on selecting the closing commentary. As said earlier this would be the *last 8-9 seconds* from the end of the video. 
Provide the start and end timestamps, a description and the reason why it helps conclude the montage.

**Consider 'key moments' to include and categorize them into the following types:**

*   **Offensive Power:** Home runs, extra-base hits, powerful hits.  *(`key_moment_type`: "Offensive Power")*
*   **Pitching Dominance:** Strikeouts, dominant pitching sequences, clutch outs by the pitcher. *(`key_moment_type`: "Pitching Dominance")*
*   **Defensive Brilliance:** Amazing catches (diving, leaping, wall-climbing), double plays, exceptional fielding plays. *(`key_moment_type`: "Defensive Brilliance")*
*   **High-Tension Moments:** Close plays at the plate/base, full counts with runners on base, game-tying or go-ahead situations, umpire reviews/challenges. *(`key_moment_type`: "High-Tension Moment")*
*   **Emotional Outbursts:**  Crowd reactions (loud cheers, gasps, standing ovations), player celebrations (exuberant reactions, fist pumps), moments of visible tension and release. *(`key_moment_type`: "Emotional Outburst")*

**Please keep in mind. Baseball game video itself contains jump cuts/transitions. Example:- Scene 1: pitcher throwing the ball, Scene 2: Batter hit a powerful strike. When you select a key moment ensure that it doesn't contain any jump cut or transitions. Meaning, One key moment should be limited to one scene**

**Prioritize moments that are visually dynamic, emotionally engaging, and represent significant plays or shifts in momentum within the game. Ensure sub clips of 'key moments' DO NOT include any graphical transitions denoting start/end of innings (i.e. "BOTTOM 4TH" or "TOP 3RD") within the sub-clip.**

And let me reitrate again. PLEASE DO NOT INCLUDE ANY GRAPHICAL TRANSITIONS/OVERLAYS DENOTING START/END OF INNINGS.
